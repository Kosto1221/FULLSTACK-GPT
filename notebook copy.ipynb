The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote ... That operation matches the style of the XZ Utils backdoor far more than the cruder supply chain attacks of APT41 or Lazarus, by comparison. \"It could very well be someone else,\" says Aitel. A backdoor was planted in the XZ utils package, a popular open-source compression utility for Linux/UNIX systems, by a threat actor named JiaT75. The backdoor exploited the SSH protocol to gain remote access and control over affected devices. A malicious code inserted into a Linux compression tool by a developer named JiaT75 could have compromised millions of systems via SSH. A Microsoft worker discovered the backdoor and alerted the open source community, preventing a major disaster. The xz-utils package, used by many Linux distributions, had a backdoor that could compromise sshd authentication.

      "Summary: In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux utility xz within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name \"Jia Tan\". The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.\n",
      "While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.\n",

      "Summary: XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. For compression/decompression the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov's LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.\n",

      "Summary: A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a \"homunculus computer\"—a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\n",
      "A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\n",
      "Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n",
      "Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.\n",

The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.[3][4]\\nWhile xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions.[5] The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.[6]\\n\\n\\nBackground[edit]\\nMicrosoft employee and PostgreSQL developer Andres Freund reported the backdoor after investigating a performance regression in Debian Sid.[7] Freund noticed that SSH connections were generating an unexpectedly high amount of CPU usage as well as causing errors in Valgrind,[8] a memory debugging tool.[9] Freund reported his finding to Openwall Project\\'s open source security mailing list,[8] which brought it to the attention of various software vendors.[9] The attacker made efforts to obfuscate the code,[10] as the backdoor consists of multiple stages that act together.[11]\\nOnce the compromised version is incorporated into the operating system, it alters the behavior of OpenSSH\\'s SSH server daemon by abusing the systemd library, allowing the attacker to gain administrator access.[11][9] According to the analysis by Red Hat, the backdoor can \"enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely\".[12]\\nA subsequent investigation found that the campaign to insert the backdoor into the XZ Utils project was a culmination of approximately three years of effort, between November 2021 and February 2024,[13] by a user going by the name Jia Tan and the nickname JiaT75 to gain access to a position of trust within the project. After a period of pressure on the founder and head maintainer to hand over the control of the project via apparent sock puppetry, Jia Tan gained the position of co-maintainer of XZ Utils and was able to sign off on version 5.6.0, which introduced the backdoor, and version 5.6.1, which patched some anomalous behavior that could have been apparent during software testing of the operating system.[9]\\nSome of the suspected sock puppetry pseudonyms include accounts with usernames like Jigar Kumar, krygorin4545, and misoeater91. It is suspected that the names Jia Tan, as well as the supposed code author Hans Jansen (for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1) are pseudonyms chosen by the participants of the campaign. Neither have any sort of visible public presence in software development beyond the short few years of the campaign.[14][15]\\nThe backdoor was notable for its level of sophistication and for the fact that the perpetrator practiced a high level of operational security for a long period of time while working to attain a position of trust. American security researcher Dave Aitel has suggested that it fits the pattern attributable to APT29, an advanced persistent threat actor believed to be working on behalf of the Russian SVR.[13] Journalist Thomas Claburn suggested that it could be any state actor or a non-state actor with considerable resources.[16]\\n\\nMechanism[edit]\\nThe malicious code is known to be in 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 releases of the XZ Utils software package. The exploit remains dormant unless a specific third-party patch of the SSH server is used. Under the right circumstances this interference could potentially enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely.[12] The malicious mechanism consists of two compressed test files that contain the malicious binary code. These files are available in the git repository, but remain dormant unless extracted and injected into the program.[2] The code uses the glibc IFUNC mechanism to replace an existing function in OpenSSH called RSA_public_decrypt with a malicious version. OpenSSH normally does not load liblzma, but a common third-party patch used by several Linux distributions causes it to load libsystemd, which in turn loads lzma.[2] A modified version of build-to-host.m4 was included in the release tar file uploaded on GitHub, which extracts a script that performs the actual injection into liblzma. This modified m4 file was not present in the git repository; it was only available from tar files released by the maintainer separate from git.[2] The script appears to perform the injection only when the system is being built on an x86-64 Linux system that uses glibc and GCC and is being built via dpkg or rpm.[2]\\n\\nResponse[edit]\\nRemediation[edit]\\nThe US federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has issued a security advisory recommending that the affected devices should roll back to a previous uncompromised version.[17] Linux software vendors, including Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian, have reverted the affected packages to older versions.[12][18][19] GitHub disabled the mirrors for the xz repository before subsequently restoring them.[20]\\nCanonical postponed the beta release of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and its flavours by a week and opted for a complete binary rebuild of all the distribution\\'s packages.[21] Although the stable version of Ubuntu was unaffected, upstream versions were. This precautionary measure was taken because Canonical could not guarantee by the original release deadline that the discovered backdoor did not affect additional packages during compilation.[22]\\n\\nBroader response[edit]\\nxkcd no. 2347 Dependency xkcd comic no. 2347 Dependency has been frequently referenced by commentators for capturing the predicament of a single unpaid volunteer maintaining critical, widely depended-upon software.[23][24]\\nComputer scientist Alex Stamos opined that \"this could have been the most widespread and effective backdoor ever planted in any software product\", noting that had the backdoor remained undetected, it would have \"given its creators a master key to any of the hundreds of millions of computers around the world that run SSH\".[25] In addition, the incident also started a discussion regarding the viability of having critical pieces of cyberinfrastructure depend on unpaid volunteers.[26]\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ The vulnerability was effectively patched within hours of discovery by reverting to a previous version known to be safe.\\n\\n^ Whether Jia Tan is a group of people, a real name of a single person or a pseudonym of a single person is not known publicly.\\n\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ Collin, Lasse. \"Remove the backdoor found in 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 (CVE-2024-3094)\".

For compression/decompression the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov\\'s LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.\\n\\n\\nFeatures[edit]\\nXZ Utils can compress and decompress the xz and lzma file formats. Since the LZMA format has been considered legacy,[2]\\nXZ Utils by default compresses to xz.\\nIn most cases, xz achieves higher compression rates than alternatives like zip,[3] gzip and bzip2. Decompression speed is higher than bzip2, but lower than gzip. Compression can be much slower than gzip, and is slower than bzip2 for high levels of compression, and is most useful when a compressed file will be used many times.[4][5]\\nXZ Utils consists of two major components:\\n\\nxz, the command-line compressor and decompressor (analogous to gzip)\\nliblzma, a software library with an API similar to zlib\\nVarious command shortcuts exist, such as lzma (for xz --format=lzma), unxz (for xz --decompress; analogous to gunzip) and xzcat (for unxz --stdout; analogous to zcat).\\n\\nUsage[edit]\\nBoth the behavior of the software and the properties of the file format have been designed to work similarly to those of the popular Unix compressing tools gzip and bzip2.\\nJust like gzip and bzip, xz and lzma can only compress single files (or data streams) as input. They cannot bundle multiple files into a single archive\\xa0–  to do this an archiving program is used first, such as tar.\\nCompressing an archive:\\n\\nxz   my_archive.tar    # results in my_archive.tar.xz\\nlzma my_archive.tar    # results in my_archive.tar.lzma\\n\\nDecompressing the archive:\\n\\nunxz    my_archive.tar.xz      # results in my_archive.tar\\nunlzma  my_archive.tar.lzma    # results in my_archive.tar\\n\\nVersion 1.22 or greater of the GNU implementation of tar has transparent support for tarballs compressed with lzma and xz, using the switches --xz or -J for xz compression, and --lzma for LZMA compression.\\nCreating an archive and compressing it:\\n\\ntar -c --xz   -f my_archive.tar.xz   /some_directory    # results in my_archive.tar.xz\\ntar -c --lzma -f my_archive.tar.lzma /some_directory    # results in my_archive.tar.lzma\\n\\nDecompressing the archive and extracting its contents:\\n\\ntar -x --xz   -f my_archive.tar.xz      # results in /some_directory\\ntar -x --lzma -f my_archive.tar.lzma    # results in /some_directory\\n\\nSingle-letter tar example for archive with compress and decompress with extract using short suffix:\\n\\ntar cJf keep.txz keep   # archive then compress the directory ./keep/ into the file ./keep.txz\\ntar xJf keep.txz        # decompress then extract the file ./keep.txz creating the directory ./keep/\\n\\nxz has supported multi-threaded compression (with the -T flag)[6] since 2014, version 5.2.0;[7] since version 5.4.0 threaded decompression has been implemented. Threaded decompression requires multiple compressed blocks within a stream which are created by the threaded compression interface. The number of threads can be less than defined if the file is not big enough for threading with the given settings or if using more threads would exceed the memory usage limit.[6]\\n\\nThe xz format[edit]\\nThe xz format improves on lzma by allowing for preprocessing filters. The exact filters used are similar to those used in 7z, as 7z\\'s filters are available in the public domain via the LZMA SDK.\\n\\nDevelopment and adoption[edit]\\nDevelopment of XZ Utils took place within the Tukaani Project, a small group of developers who once maintained a Linux distribution based on Slackware.\\nThe .xz file format specification version 1.0.0 was officially released in January 2009.[8]\\nAll of the source code for xz and liblzma has been released into the public domain. The XZ Utils source distribution additionally includes some optional scripts and an example program that are subject to various versions of the GNU General Public License (GPL).[1] The resulting software xz and liblzma binaries are public domain, unless the optional LGPL getopt implementation is incorporated.[9]\\nBinaries are available for FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux systems, Microsoft Windows, and FreeDOS. A number of Linux distributions, including Fedora, Slackware, Ubuntu, and Debian use xz for compressing their software packages. Arch Linux previously used xz to compress packages,[10] but as of December 27, 2019, packages are compressed with Zstandard compression.[11] Fedora Linux also switched to compressing its RPM packages with Zstandard with Fedora Linux 31.[12] The GNU FTP archive also uses xz.\\n\\nBackdoor incident[edit]\\nMain article: XZ Utils backdoor\\nOn 29 March 2024, Andres Freund, a PostgreSQL developer working at Microsoft, announced that he had found a backdoor in XZ Utils, impacting versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. Compressed test files had been added to the code for setting up the backdoor via additions to the configure script in the tar files. He started his investigation because \"After observing a few odd symptoms around liblzma (part of the xz package)\" as he found that ssh logins using sshd were \"taking a lot of CPU, valgrind errors\".[13] The vulnerability received a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 10 (the highest).[14]\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ a b Licensing on tukaani.org \"The most interesting parts of XZ Utils (e.g. liblzma) are in the public domain.

From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\\nA backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program,[3] a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware,[4] or parts of an operating system such as Windows.[5][6][7] Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor.[8] Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\\nMany systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system.[9] Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version.[10] In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.[11]\\nRecent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors\\' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.[12]\\n\\n\\nOverview[edit]\\nThe threat of backdoors surfaced when multiuser and networked operating systems became widely adopted. Petersen and Turn discussed computer subversion in a paper published in the proceedings of the 1967 AFIPS Conference.[13] They noted a class of active infiltration attacks that use \"trapdoor\" entry points into the system to bypass security facilities and permit direct access to data. The use of the word trapdoor here clearly coincides with more recent definitions of a backdoor. However, since the advent of public key cryptography the term trapdoor has acquired a different meaning (see trapdoor function), and thus the term \"backdoor\" is now preferred, only after the term trapdoor went out of use. More generally, such security breaches were discussed at length in a RAND Corporation task force report published under DARPA sponsorship by J.P. Anderson and D.J. Edwards in 1970.[14]\\nWhile initially targeting the computer vision domain, backdoor attacks have expanded to encompass various other domains, including text, audio, ML-based computer-aided design, and ML-based wireless signal classification. Additionally, vulnerabilities in backdoors have been demonstrated in deep generative models, reinforcement learning (e.g., AI GO), and deep graph models. These broad-ranging potential risks have prompted concerns from national security agencies regarding their potentially disastrous consequences.[15]\\nA backdoor in a login system might take the form of a hard coded user and password combination which gives access to the system. An example of this sort of backdoor was used as a plot device in the 1983 film WarGames, in which the architect of the \"WOPR\" computer system had inserted a hardcoded password-less account which gave the user access to the system, and to undocumented parts of the system (in particular, a video game-like simulation mode and direct interaction with the artificial intelligence).\\nAlthough the number of backdoors in systems using proprietary software (software whose source code is not publicly available) is not widely credited, they are nevertheless frequently exposed. Programmers have even succeeded in secretly installing large amounts of benign code as Easter eggs in programs, although such cases may involve official forbearance, if not actual permission.\\n\\nPolitics and attribution[edit]\\nThis section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (June 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\\nThere are a number of cloak and dagger considerations that come into play when apportioning responsibility.\\nCovert backdoors sometimes masquerade as inadvertent defects (bugs) for reasons of plausible deniability. In some cases, these might begin life as an actual bug (inadvertent error), which, once discovered are then deliberately left unfixed and undisclosed, whether by a rogue employee for personal advantage, or with C-level executive awareness and oversight.\\nIt is also possible for an entirely above-board corporation\\'s technology base to be covertly and untraceably tainted by external agents (hackers), though this level of sophistication is thought to exist mainly at the level of nation state actors. For example, if a photomask obtained from a photomask supplier differs in a few gates from its photomask specification, a chip manufacturer would be hard-pressed to detect this if otherwise functionally silent; a covert rootkit running in the photomask etching equipment could enact this discrepancy unbeknown to the photomask manufacturer, either, and by such means, one backdoor potentially leads to another.[note 1]\\nIn general terms, the long dependency-chains in the modern, highly specialized technological economy and innumerable human-elements process control-points make it difficult to conclusively pinpoint responsibility at such time as a covert backdoor becomes unveiled.\\nEven direct admissions of responsibility must be scrutinized carefully if the confessing party is beholden to other powerful interests.\\n\\nExamples[edit]\\nWorms[edit]\\nMany computer worms, such as Sobig and Mydoom, install a backdoor on the affected computer (generally a PC on broadband running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Outlook). Such backdoors appear to be installed so that spammers can send junk e-mail from the infected machines. Others, such as the Sony/BMG rootkit, placed secretly on millions of music CDs through late 2005, are intended as DRM measures—and, in that case, as data-gathering agents, since both surreptitious programs they installed routinely contacted central servers.\\nA sophisticated attempt to plant a backdoor in the Linux kernel, exposed in November 2003, added a small and subtle code change by subverting the revision control system.[16] In this case, a two-line change appeared to check root access permissions of a caller to the sys_wait4 function, but because it used assignment = instead of equality checking ==, it actually granted permissions to the system. This difference is easily overlooked, and could even be interpreted as an accidental typographical error, rather than an intentional attack.[17][18]\\n\\nMarked in yellow: backdoor admin password hidden in the code\\nIn January 2014, a backdoor was discovered in certain Samsung Android products, like the Galaxy devices. The Samsung proprietary Android versions are fitted with a backdoor that provides remote access to the data stored on the device. In particular, the Samsung Android software that is in charge of handling the communications with the modem, using the Samsung IPC protocol, implements a class of requests known as remote file server (RFS) commands, that allows the backdoor operator to perform via modem remote I/O operations on the device hard disk or other storage. As the modem is running Samsung proprietary Android software, it is likely that it offers over-the-air remote control that could then be used to issue the RFS commands and thus to access the file system on the device.[19]\\n\\nObject code backdoors[edit]\\nHarder to detect backdoors involve modifying object code, rather than source code—object code is much harder to inspect, as it is designed to be machine-readable, not human-readable. These backdoors can be inserted either directly in the on-disk object code, or inserted at some point during compilation, assembly linking, or loading—in the latter case the backdoor never appears on disk, only in memory. Object code backdoors are difficult to detect by inspection of the object code, but are easily detected by simply checking for changes (differences), notably in length or in checksum, and in some cases can be detected or analyzed by disassembling the object code. Further, object code backdoors can be removed (assuming source code is available) by simply recompiling from source on a trusted system.\\nThus for such backdoors to avoid detection, all extant copies of a binary must be subverted, and any validation checksums must also be compromised, and source must be unavailable, to prevent recompilation. Alternatively, these other tools (length checks, diff, checksumming, disassemblers) can themselves be compromised to conceal the backdoor, for example detecting that the subverted binary is being checksummed and returning the expected value, not the actual value. To conceal these further subversions, the tools must also conceal the changes in themselves—for example, a subverted checksummer must also detect if it is checksumming itself (or other subverted tools) and return false values. This leads to extensive changes in the system and tools being needed to conceal a single change.\\nAs object code can be regenerated by recompiling (reassembling, relinking) the original source code, making a persistent object code backdoor (without modifying source code) requires subverting the compiler itself—so that when it detects that it is compiling the program under attack it inserts the backdoor—or alternatively the assembler, linker, or loader. As this requires subverting the compiler, this in turn can be fixed by recompiling the compiler, removing the backdoor insertion code. This defense can in turn be subverted by putting a source meta-backdoor in the compiler, so that when it detects that it is compiling itself it then inserts this meta-backdoor generator, together with the original backdoor generator for the original program under attack. After this is done, the source meta-backdoor can be removed, and the compiler recompiled from original source with the compromised compiler executable: the backdoor has been bootstrapped. This attack dates to a 1974 paper by Karger and Schell,[20] and was popularized in Thompson\\'s 1984 article, entitled \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\";[21] it is hence colloquially known as the \"Trusting Trust\" attack. See compiler backdoors, below, for details. Analogous attacks can target lower levels of the system,\\nsuch as the operating system, and can be inserted during the system booting process; these are also mentioned by Karger and Schell in 1974, and now exist in the form of boot sector viruses.[20][22]\\n\\nAsymmetric backdoors[edit]\\nA traditional backdoor is a symmetric backdoor: anyone that finds the backdoor can in turn use it. The notion of an asymmetric backdoor was introduced by Adam Young and Moti Yung in the Proceedings of Advances in Cryptology – Crypto \\'96. An asymmetric backdoor can only be used by the attacker who plants it, even if the full implementation of the backdoor becomes public (e.g. via publishing, being discovered and disclosed by reverse engineering, etc.). Also, it is computationally intractable to detect the presence of an asymmetric backdoor under black-box queries. This class of attacks have been termed kleptography; they can be carried out in software, hardware (for example, smartcards), or a combination of the two. The theory of asymmetric backdoors is part of a larger field now called cryptovirology. Notably, NSA inserted a kleptographic backdoor into the Dual EC DRBG standard.[4][23][24]\\nThere exists an experimental asymmetric backdoor in RSA key generation. This OpenSSL RSA backdoor, designed by Young and Yung, utilizes a twisted pair of elliptic curves, and has been made available.[25]\\n\\nCompiler backdoors[edit]\\nA sophisticated form of black box backdoor is a compiler backdoor, where not only is a compiler subverted—to insert a backdoor in some other program, such as a login program—but it is further modified to detect when it is compiling itself and then inserts both the backdoor insertion code (targeting the other program) and the code-modifying self-compilation, like the mechanism through which retroviruses infect their host. This can be done by modifying the source code, and the resulting compromised compiler (object code) can compile the original (unmodified) source code and insert itself: the exploit has been boot-strapped.\\nThis attack was originally presented in Karger & Schell (1974),[note 2] which was a United States Air Force security analysis of Multics, where they described such an attack on a PL/I compiler, and call it a \"compiler trap door\". They also mention a variant where the system initialization code is modified to insert a backdoor during booting, as this is complex and poorly understood, and call it an \"initialization trapdoor\"; this is now known as a boot sector virus.[22]\\nThis attack was then actually implemented by Ken Thompson, and popularized in his Turing Award acceptance speech in 1983, \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\",[21] which points out that trust is relative, and the only software one can truly trust is code where every step of the bootstrapping has been inspected. This backdoor mechanism is based on the fact that people only review source (human-written) code, and not compiled machine code (object code). A program called a compiler is used to create the second from the first, and the compiler is usually trusted to do an honest job.\\nThompson\\'s paper[21] describes a modified version of the Unix C compiler that would put an invisible backdoor in the Unix login command when it noticed that the login program was being compiled, and would also add this feature undetectably to future compiler versions upon their compilation as well. As the compiler itself was a compiled program, users would be extremely unlikely to notice the machine code instructions that performed these tasks. (Because of the second task, the compiler\\'s source code would appear \"clean\".) What\\'s worse, in Thompson\\'s proof of concept implementation, the subverted compiler also subverted the analysis program (the disassembler), so that anyone who examined the binaries in the usual way would not actually see the real code that was running, but something else instead.\\nKarger and Schell gave an updated analysis of the original exploit in 2002, and, in 2009, Wheeler wrote a historical overview and survey of the literature.[note 3] In 2023, Cox published an annotated version of Thompson\\'s backdoor source code.[27]\\n\\nOccurrences[edit]\\nThompson\\'s version was, officially, never released into the wild. However, it is believed that a version was distributed to BBN and at least one use of the backdoor was recorded.[note 4] There are scattered anecdotal reports of such backdoors in subsequent years.\\nIn August 2009, an attack of this kind was discovered by Sophos labs. The W32/Induc-A virus infected the program compiler for Delphi, a Windows programming language. The virus introduced its own code to the compilation of new Delphi programs, allowing it to infect and propagate to many systems, without the knowledge of the software programmer. The virus looks for a Delphi installation, modifies the SysConst.pas file, which is the source code of a part of the standard library and compiles it. After that, every program compiled by that Delphi installation will contain the virus. An attack that propagates by building its own Trojan horse can be especially hard to discover. It resulted in many software vendors releasing infected executables without realizing it, sometimes claiming false positives. After all, the executable was not tampered with, the compiler was. It is believed that the Induc-A virus had been propagating for at least a year before it was discovered.[note 5]\\nIn 2015, a malicious copy of Xcode, XcodeGhost, also performed a similar attack and infected iOS apps from a dozen of software companies in China. Globally, 4,000 apps were found to be affected. It was not a true Thompson Trojan, as it does not infect development tools themselves, but it did prove that toolchain poisoning can cause substantial damages.[30]\\n\\nCountermeasures[edit]\\nOnce a system has been compromised with a backdoor or Trojan horse, such as the Trusting Trust compiler, it is very hard for the \"rightful\" user to regain control of the system – typically one should rebuild a clean system and transfer data (but not executables) over. However, several practical weaknesses in the Trusting Trust scheme have been suggested.  For example, a sufficiently motivated user could painstakingly review the machine code of the untrusted compiler before using it. As mentioned above, there are ways to hide the Trojan horse, such as subverting the disassembler; but there are ways to counter that defense, too, such as writing a disassembler from scratch.[citation needed]\\nA generic method to counter trusting trust attacks is called diverse double-compiling. The method requires a different compiler and the source code of the compiler-under-test. That source, compiled with both compilers, results in two different stage-1 compilers, which however should have the same behavior. Thus the same source compiled with both stage-1 compilers must then result in two identical stage-2 compilers. A formal proof is given that the latter comparison guarantees that the purported source code and executable of the compiler-under-test correspond, under some assumptions. This method was applied by its author to verify that the C compiler of the GCC suite (v. 3.0.4) contained no trojan, using icc (v. 11.0) as the different compiler.[26]\\nIn practice such verifications are not done by end users, except in extreme circumstances of intrusion detection and analysis, due to the rarity of such sophisticated attacks, and because programs are typically distributed in binary form. Removing backdoors (including compiler backdoors) is typically done by simply rebuilding a clean system. However, the sophisticated verifications are of interest to operating system vendors, to ensure that they are not distributing a compromised system, and in high-security settings, where such attacks are a realistic concern.\\n\\nList of known backdoors[edit]\\nBack Orifice was created in 1998 by hackers from Cult of the Dead Cow group as a remote administration tool. It allowed Windows computers to be remotely controlled over a network and parodied the name of Microsoft\\'s BackOffice.\\nThe Dual EC DRBG cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator was revealed in 2013 to possibly have a kleptographic backdoor deliberately inserted by NSA, who also had the private key to the backdoor.[4][24]\\nSeveral backdoors in the unlicensed copies of WordPress plug-ins were discovered in March 2014.[31] They were inserted as obfuscated JavaScript code and silently created, for example, an admin account in the website database. A similar scheme was later exposed in a Joomla plugin.[32]\\nBorland Interbase versions 4.0 through 6.0 had a hard-coded backdoor, put there by the developers. The server code contains a compiled-in backdoor account (username: politically, password: correct), which could be accessed over a network connection; a user logging in with this backdoor account could take full control over all Interbase databases. The backdoor was detected in 2001 and a patch was released.[33][34]\\nJuniper Networks backdoor inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of firmware ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20[35] that gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.[36]\\nSeveral backdoors were discovered in C-DATA Optical Line Termination (OLT) devices.[37] Researchers released the findings without notifying C-DATA because they believe the backdoors were intentionally placed by the vendor.[38]\\nA backdoor in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of the popular Linux utility XZ Utils was discovered in March 2024 by software developer Andres Freund.[39] The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux systems. The issue has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.[40][41][42]\\nSee also[edit]\\nBackdoor:Win32.Hupigon\\nHardware backdoor\\nTitanium (malware)\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ This hypothetical scenario is essentially a silicon version of the undetectable #compiler backdoors\\n\\n^ Specifically Section 3.4.5 \"Trap Door Insertion\"[20]:\\u200a52\\u200a\\n\\n^ Karger & Schell (2002): Section 3.2.4: Compiler trap doors[22]:\\u200a52\\u200aWheeler (2009): Section 2: Background and related work[26]\\n\\n^ Jargon File entry for \"backdoor\" describes Thompson compiler hack[28]\\n\\n^ Sophos labs on the discovery of the Induc-A virus[29]\\n\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ Eckersley, Peter; Portnoy, Erica (8 May 2017). \"Intel\\'s Management Engine is a security hazard, and users need a way to disable it\". www.eff.org.

Here are the key details about the incident:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Background\n",
      "- In **February 2024**, a malicious backdoor was introduced into the XZ Utils software, specifically in versions **5.6.0** and **5.6.1** of the liblzma library. This was done by an individual or group using the pseudonym **Jia Tan**.\n",
      "- The backdoor allows an attacker with a specific **Ed448 private key** to execute remote code on affected Linux systems. This vulnerability was assigned the **CVE identifier CVE-2024-3094** and received a **CVSS score of 10.0**, indicating a critical severity level.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discovery\n",
      "- The backdoor was discovered by **Andres Freund**, a software developer at Microsoft, on **March 29, 2024**. He noticed unusual CPU usage and errors related to SSH connections while investigating performance issues in Debian Sid.\n",
      "- The malicious code was designed to alter the behavior of the OpenSSH SSH server daemon, enabling unauthorized remote access to the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Mechanism\n",
      "- The backdoor was sophisticated, consisting of multiple stages and obfuscation techniques. It remained dormant unless specific conditions were met, such as the use of a third-party patch for the SSH server.\n",
      "- The malicious code involved modifying the function `RSA_public_decrypt` in OpenSSH, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Response\n",
      "- Following the discovery, various Linux distributions, including **Red Hat**, **SUSE**, and **Debian**, reverted to earlier, uncompromised versions of the software.\n",
      "- The **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)** issued advisories recommending that affected systems roll back to safe versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Broader Implications\n",
      "- The incident raised concerns about the security of open-source software, particularly regarding the reliance on unpaid volunteers for maintaining critical infrastructure.\n",
      "- Experts noted that had the backdoor gone undetected, it could have provided extensive access to numerous systems worldwide, potentially affecting hundreds of millions of computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The XZ backdoor incident highlights the vulnerabilities inherent in software supply chains, especially in open-source projects where trust and security practices are paramount. It serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance in software development and maintenance.\n",

       " 'output': 'The **XZ backdoor** refers to a significant security vulnerability discovered in the XZ Utils software, which is a widely used data compression utility for Linux and UNIX systems. Here are the key details about the incident:\\n\\n### Background\\n- In **February 2024**, a malicious backdoor was introduced into the XZ Utils software, specifically in versions **5.6.0** and **5.6.1** of the liblzma library. This was done by an individual or group using the pseudonym **Jia Tan**.\\n- The backdoor allows an attacker with a specific **Ed448 private key** to execute remote code on affected Linux systems. This vulnerability was assigned the **CVE identifier CVE-2024-3094** and received a **CVSS score of 10.0**, indicating a critical severity level.\\n\\n### Discovery\\n- The backdoor was discovered by **Andres Freund**, a software developer at Microsoft, on **March 29, 2024**. He noticed unusual CPU usage and errors related to SSH connections while investigating performance issues in Debian Sid.\\n- The malicious code was designed to alter the behavior of the OpenSSH SSH server daemon, enabling unauthorized remote access to the system.\\n\\n### Mechanism\\n- The backdoor was sophisticated, consisting of multiple stages and obfuscation techniques. It remained dormant unless specific conditions were met, such as the use of a third-party patch for the SSH server.\\n- The malicious code involved modifying the function `RSA_public_decrypt` in OpenSSH, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms.\\n\\n### Response\\n- Following the discovery, various Linux distributions, including **Red Hat**, **SUSE**, and **Debian**, reverted to earlier, uncompromised versions of the software.\\n- The **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)** issued advisories recommending that affected systems roll back to safe versions.\\n\\n### Broader Implications\\n- The incident raised concerns about the security of open-source software, particularly regarding the reliance on unpaid volunteers for maintaining critical infrastructure.\\n- Experts noted that had the backdoor gone undetected, it could have provided extensive access to numerous systems worldwide, potentially affecting hundreds of millions of computers.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe XZ backdoor incident highlights the vulnerabilities inherent in software supply chains, especially in open-source projects where trust and security practices are paramount. It serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance in software development and maintenance.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [XZ Utils backdoor - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor)\\n- [XZ Utils - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils)\\n- [Backdoor (computing) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing))'}"
